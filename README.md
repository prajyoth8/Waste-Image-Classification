# Waste-Image-Classification
## Project Overview
This project focuses on applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify waste images into various categories such as 'battery', 'biological', 'cardboard', 'clothes', 'glass', 'metal', 'paper', 'plastic', 'shoes', and 'trash'. By leveraging a pre-trained VGG16 model and fine-tuning it for our specific task, we aim to enhance waste management processes through improved automation and accuracy in waste segregation.

## Motivation
Proper waste segregation is crucial for effective recycling, reducing landfill use, and conserving resources. Traditional manual sorting methods are prone to errors and inefficiencies. This project explores how AI can be harnessed to address these challenges, contributing to more sustainable waste management practices.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises images across various waste categories, essential for training the CNN model. Details about the dataset source, its structure, and preprocessing steps are included to provide a comprehensive understanding of the data foundation for this project.

## Model Architecture
The core of the project is built on the VGG16 architecture, known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks. The model is adapted and fine-tuned to suit the specific requirements of waste image classification, with additional layers and training strategies implemented to optimize performance.

## Results
The trained model demonstrates promising results in accurately classifying waste images. The repository includes detailed accuracy and loss metrics, along with a confusion matrix, to offer insights into the model's performance. 

## Getting Started
Instructions on how to set up the project, including environment setup, library installations, and steps to run the model, are provided to facilitate ease of replication and further experimentation.
